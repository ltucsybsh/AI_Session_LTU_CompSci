    "YOLO is specifically trained for **detailed object detection**, rather than general image classification like MobileNet. It's trained to recognize and accurately label many specific objects, making it much more suitable for tasks needing precise recognition (e.g., differentiating between cars, people, bikes, and more in a single image).\n",
